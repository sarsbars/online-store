# Online Store ðŸ›’

This is an online store web application built with React, utilizing the FakeStore API to create a dynamic e-commerce experience. This project was developed as the final project for the Introduction to React course (SD-260) at Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology. The application features a responsive design inspired by professional e-commerce websites.

## Project Features
- **Multiple Pages**: Includes four core pages: Home, Product (Detail), Cart, and NotFound (404 page), built using React components for modularity.
- **FakeStore API Integration**: Fetches product data dynamically using `axios` from `https://fakestoreapi.com` to populate the storeâ€™s inventory.
- **Product Sorting**: The Home page allows users to sort products by price (low to high, high to low) and name (A-Z, Z-A) via a dropdown menu.
- **Product Detail Page**: Displays detailed product information, including image, title, description, price, and an "Add to Cart" button, with a gallery of three similar products below.
- **Cart Functionality**: Utilizes a `CartProvider` context to manage cart state across the application, allowing users to add products to the cart.
- **Routing**: Implements `react-router-dom` for navigation, with proper route management and redirection to the NotFound page for invalid routes or product IDs.
- **Professional Design**: Incorporates `framer-motion` for smooth page transitions and a responsive layout inspired by [Behance E-Commerce Furniture Website Design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/226078053/E-Commerce-Furniture-Website-Design) and [Dribbble Furniture E-Commerce Website Design](https://dribbble.com/shots/25501129-Furniture-E-Commerce-Website-Design).
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Utilizes reusable components such as `Header`, `HeroBanner`, `ProductGallery`, `Stats`, `WhatWeOffer`, `ContactForm`, and more for a modular structure.
- **Hosted on GitHub Pages**: The site is deployed at [https://sarsbars.github.io/online-store/](https://sarsbars.github.io/online-store/).
